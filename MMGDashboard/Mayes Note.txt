Hey just a note... 

This is not a complete fileset.  They are just the files I changed.

Also, I didn't take a good initial, it sort of trickled in as I made more adjustments.  If we need me to pull it out I can.



My repo log before I rebased it (I did myself no favors with the commit messages):
