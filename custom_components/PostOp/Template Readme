This project folder is basically able to be copy pasted into the mpage folder, and some minor work necessary to
get it able to be specific to the project:
    1) The .prg file needs to be renamed, and have the todo checklist in that file run through.
    2) The .JS and .CSS need to be renamed and their new locations placed in the .prg image onload
    3) In the custom component .js (I:\WININTEL\static_content\custom_mpage_content\custom-components\js\custom-components.js), 
       you'll need to add the information to allow it to call your program.  To do that:
        a) Make sure to make a backup before changing the file.  Normal procedure.
        b) Add this code to the custom component JS:
              
              var [driverScriptVar] = {
                  cclProgram: "[DRIVER SCRIPT NAME]",
                  cclParams: ["mine"]
              };
           
           Note you can send more params, I just didn't need to yet.  Obviously you need to change the driver script name to your
           projects.  The [driverScriptVar] name should be unique and related to your project.
    4) To set up Bedrock:  
        a) Find the custom component you are going to use.  This should be on the mPage setup bedrock wizard.  Try not to steal any.
        b) You can check the basic positioning and such by picking define mPage layout.  You can tell the undefined custom 
           components this way too.  Make sure it is checked if you are going to test so it displays in the layout.
        c) Then in the back in the normal wizard, pick that custom component and look at it's filters.
        d) Name it how you want.
        e) Namespace is cerner.custom_component
        f) Component Options is the js object name used for [driverScriptVar] above (verbatim).

Notes:
    Changes to our CSS or JS happen off the webserver it seems so cycling that is not necessary.
    The change to add the component to custom-components may require a webserver refresh.  To do that:
        1) Run this query to get the url to use:
               select concat(trim(info_char,3), '/manager')
                 from dm_info 
                where info_domain = 'INS'
                  and info_name = 'CONTENT_SERVICE_URL'
               go
        2) Open that url in the citrix session (you can use the cups folder and link in the main support folder)
        3) Refresh the custom-components section and refresh until they are both refreshed 
           (Issues here might require a cache clear, although I haven't had to do that yet)
    Bedrock changes require a cycling of the mPage servers (not the webserver).  
    Changes to any backend scripts may also require cycling mPage servers.
